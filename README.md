# YouTube-likes-Count-prediction

Linear Regression Model to predict likes of a youtube video.

Implemented a machine learning model to predict the number of likes on YouTube videos based on various features including views, dislikes, comment count, and category ID. Leveraged linear regression algorithm for its simplicity and interpretability. Achieved a commendable accuracy score of 73%, indicating the model's effectiveness in estimating like counts. This project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Additionally, utilized libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

Key Contributions:

Collected and preprocessed YouTube video data, ensuring data quality and consistency.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between features and like counts.
Engineered relevant features to enhance model performance and interpretability.
Implemented a linear regression model and fine-tuned its parameters to optimize predictive accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations, demonstrating a 73% accuracy score.
Documented the project thoroughly with clear explanations of methodologies, results, and insights gained.
